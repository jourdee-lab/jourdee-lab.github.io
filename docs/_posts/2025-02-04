## Welcome to my Red Hat Placement Diary!

* I will bring you along my first week as an intern at Red Hat.
* This includes talking about my daily routine and the various things in and out the office.
* So please join along and enjoy the blog below!


## First Day 

My first day at the Waterford office was one for the books! I met up with the rest of my engineering intern cohort, and we immediately hit it off, chatting away and sharing our excitement for the journey ahead. The warm welcome started as soon as I walked in—my own desk was waiting for me, complete with some awesome Red Hat swag (a hoodie, hat, and bag!). Talk about making a first impression! After settling in, we went on a tour of the office. I had the chance to meet some incredibly talented engineers and, of course, my manager, Paul. Everyone was friendly and passionate about their work, which really set the tone for the rest of my time there. We were given an introduction to the internship program, with some insight into what we could expect and possible future opportunities within Red Hat. It was exciting to hear about the potential paths ahead and how we'd be contributing to meaningful projects. Next, I was assigned to the TAS (Trusted Artifact Signer) team. I’m really looking forward to getting involved with the team and learning from some of the best in the business. Afterward, we had a team lunch at a local bar. It was a great opportunity to unwind and get to know my fellow interns and the team in a more relaxed setting. I also met my “buddy/mentor,” who will be guiding me throughout my internship. Having someone to turn to for advice and support is reassuring, and I can already tell this mentorship is going to be invaluable. The day wrapped up with setting up our laptops, and just like that, my internship journey had begun!
